risefall_lstm_train.py

Standalone training service for the RISEFALL bot's LSTM layer(s). Deployed
as a Railway service on a CRON schedule, same pattern as
expiryrange_lstm_train.py -- one run, exits, safe to trigger manually.

TRAINS ONE MODEL PER RUN, PICKED BY MODEL_KIND
----------------------------------------------------------------------
MODEL_KIND=tick   -> trains RiseFallWinClassifier(kind="tick"),   window
                     is raw tick log-returns, labels use raw tick counts
                     as duration (matches CANDIDATE_DURATIONS in
                     risefall_bot_v4_hmm_gbm.py).
MODEL_KIND=minute -> trains RiseFallWinClassifier(kind="minute"), window
                     is minute-bar log-returns (see build_minute_bars()
                     below), labels use minute counts as duration.

Run this twice on the CRON schedule (two Railway cron triggers, or one
service invoked with both env values) to keep both models fresh -- they are
independent checkpoints and never share a state_dict. See
risefall_lstm_model.py's module docstring for why they're kept separate
instead of one model conditioned on a unit flag.

LABEL CONSTRUCTION -- simpler than EXPIRYRANGE, by design
----------------------------------------------------------------------
RISEFALL settles on direction alone: label = 1.0 if
price[t + duration] > price[t], else 0.0. No barrier, no local-vol term.
Exact ties (terminal == entry) are dropped rather than labeled either way --
real Deriv Rise/Fall contracts have their own tie-handling rules that don't
matter for what this classifier needs to learn (the direction, given it
actually moved).

MINUTE BARS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Deriv's ticks_history gives a raw tick stream, not pre-built minute bars.
build_minute_bars() resamples it: for each whole minute (floor(epoch/60)),
takes the LAST tick price observed in that minute (last-observation, not
OHLC-close-vs-open -- matches how a Rise/Fall minute contract actually
settles: against the price prevailing at the expiry instant, not a
synthetic bar close). Minutes with zero ticks (should be rare on an
always-on synthetic index, but not impossible around a reconnect gap) are
forward-filled from the prior minute's last price -- NOT interpolated,
since interpolation would leak the (unknown, real) intra-gap path into a
label.

Env vars required (same as expiryrange_lstm_train.py):

                                    below. (RISEFALL_TRAIN_SYMBOL, singular,
                                    still works as a one-symbol override.)
  LSTM_MAX_TICKS                   TOTAL tick budget across the whole

                                    Defaults to 300000 for tick mode,
                                    800000 for minute mode (minute mode
                                    needs far more raw ticks per symbol to
                                    accumulate enough distinct one-minute
                                    bars -- see WINDOW_SIZE_MINUTES -- but
                                    Deriv's ticks_history retention limit
                                    for at least some symbols is only
                                    ~86,400 ticks/~24h, see
                                    fetch_full_history()'s retention-

  LSTM_MAX_TRAIN_EXAMPLES          default 50000 -- caps the POOLED
                                    training-example total across every
                                    symbol (see cap_pooled_examples()).
                                    Without any cap, wall-clock time scales
                                    linearly with len(TRAIN_SYMBOLS): a
                                    full 10-symbol basket with no cap at
                                    all measured out to ~2 CPU-hours for
                                    one MODEL_KIND run (main model +

                                    the full pooled set). Raised from an

                                    LSTM_EPOCHS defaults to 30 (deep
                                    training was an explicit ask) --
                                    expect roughly 60-90 minutes per run
                                    at these defaults on a modest Railway
                                    CPU plan, comfortably inside the 5h
                                    cron window. Lower this first if a run
                                    risks overrunning that window.
  LSTM_MAX_VAL_EXAMPLES            default 10000 -- same idea, validation
                                    side.
  LSTM_ARCHIVE_MINUTE_BARS         default "true" -- see PERSISTENT
                                    ARCHIVE below.
  LSTM_ARCHIVE_MAX_DAYS            default 45 -- how much accumulated
                                    minute-bar history to keep/use per
                                    symbol.
  LSTM_REQUIRE_BEAT_PERSISTENCE    default "true" -- see BASELINE
                                    DIAGNOSTICS below; aborts the Supabase
                                    upload (keeping whatever model is
                                    already live) if the LSTM doesn't beat
                                    a naive persistence baseline out of
                                    sample on this run's val split.

PERSISTENT ARCHIVE + WARM-START -- working around Deriv's ~24h retention
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Deriv's ticks_history API only retains ~24h of raw ticks per symbol (see
fetch_full_history()'s retention-boundary detection) -- every single cron
run, on its own, can only ever see roughly the same ~22h window. Two
things compensate for that:

1. Every minute-mode run upserts its freshly resampled bars into
   bot_risefall_minute_bars (Supabase, deduped on symbol+epoch -- see
   _archive_upsert_minute_bars()), then trains on the FULL accumulated
   archive (up to LSTM_ARCHIVE_MAX_DAYS back) rather than just this run's
   fresh fetch. Real longitudinal history accumulates across cron cycles
   even though no single fetch can ever see more than ~24h.
2. Every run also warm-starts from whichever model is currently live in
   Supabase (load_warm_start_state()) instead of reinitializing from
   scratch, so whatever a previous cycle learned carries forward. Safe by
   construction: still gated by LSTM_REQUIRE_BEAT_PERSISTENCE before any
   upload, so a bad warm-start can only fail to improve on the live model,
   never silently replace it with something worse.

MULTI-SYMBOL TRAINING -- one shared model, a pooled basket of symbols
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There's still exactly one served state_dict per MODEL_KIND (not one per
symbol) -- risefall_bot_v4_hmm_gbm.py's Gate 6 applies whichever tick/
minute model is current to EVERY symbol it evaluates. Since the live
bot's symbol universe is discovered dynamically every deep calibration
(fetch_tradable_symbols()/select_top_1hz()) and isn't fully known even at
training time, this file fetches history and builds labeled examples
SEPARATELY per symbol in TRAIN_SYMBOLS (never mixing one symbol's return
series with another's -- see build_symbol_split()), then pools all of
them into one combined train/val set via torch's ConcatDataset. Combined
with local_normalize() in risefall_lstm_model.py (per-window normalization,
not a single global scalar), the served model ends up scale-invariant
across the whole basket rather than calibrated to whichever one symbol
happened to be hardcoded before.

BASELINE DIAGNOSTICS -- "is the LSTM actually earning its keep?"
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Every training run also fits a naive persistence baseline, an AR(1) +
rescaled-range Hurst-exponent baseline, a HistGradientBoostingClassifier
on hand-engineered return-window features, a compact GRU, and a compact
dilated causal CNN -- all scored on the SAME purged validation split the
served LSTM ensemble is scored on, logged as a comparison table, and
uploaded alongside the model in Supabase's `baseline_comparison` column
(JSON). None of these five are served to the live bot; they exist purely
so you (or Gate 6's operator) can tell whether the LSTM's extra complexity
is finding real signal or just quietly overfitting to noise a much cheaper
model would also fit. See run_baseline_diagnostics() below.
